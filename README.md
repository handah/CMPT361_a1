# CMPT361_a1
This repository presents the solutions for a two-part assignment covering green screen matting for virtual tourism (assignment1Part1.m, a1p1_2.m)and image blending ().

To run assignment1Part1.m, you have to put my script and the images that you want to test in the same folder. Then, click on the run button, it will show you the results. To change images, change the photo names at line 6 and line 7 of assignment1Part1.m

To run script is a1p1_2.m, you also have to put the images and the script in the same folder. After clicking on run, the command line will ask you to enter a value between 0 and 0.5, I recommand entering 0.5 to see a obvious patterns of the non-binary map, or 0.3 to see a normal map and result image. To change images, change the image names at line 6 and line 10 of a1p1_2.m.

To  run a1p2.m, save all the images you want to test and the scripts in the same folder. Recommend using square images because it looks better. Just click on run and everything is there. To change
images, change line 6, line 28, line 50 of a1p2_1.m To show the pyramids, uncomment the lines at line 91. I arranged the order of images in the opposite direction, and I commented this out at those
three lines.

For details about what alogrithms are involved during implementation, please see the report. To see the instructions on this assignment, please see CMPT361Ass1.pdf
